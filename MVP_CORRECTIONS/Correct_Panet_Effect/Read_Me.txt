My idea to indicate that the player has selected the correct planet is to make some little stars appear accompanying a shooting star.

I think this effect is very striking and quite unique from other games.

I've taken the liberty of creating the animation for this as a ready-to-use GIF and AVI (no background).
I have also left an example video of how it looks, in which the blue circle represents the planet in question.
